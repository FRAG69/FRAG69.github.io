# Who am I?

I'm a 30 something developer, currently working on [Operation: Black Mesa](https://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa) as a level designer using the **CSGO** branch of the [Source engine](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source)

I also work as a part time Technical Demonstrator at [Plymouth College of Art](https://www.plymouthart.ac.uk) where I run workshops covering Unreal Engine 4 & Virtual Reality creative practices for the BA Game Arts course there.

## Current Side Projects

Currently learning Python & MicroPython and making apps for the [Campzone 2019 iPane badge](https://wiki.badge.team/CZ19)
